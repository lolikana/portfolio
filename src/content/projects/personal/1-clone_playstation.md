Discover my PlayStation Website Clone, a front-end project crafted with TypeScript, Vanilla JS, HTML, SCSS, and Webpack. Mimicking PlayStation's homepage, it showcases a responsive design, a Swiper carousel for featured games, and dynamic game lists fetched from the RAWG API. Visit the project on Vercel to explore its interactive elements and design similarities with the official PlayStation website.
